# Project Railgun ([中文介绍](README_zh.md))

A **railgun** for your (wireless) router(s).

***

### Usage

Go to release or Actions CI page. Use at your discretion.


> **Warning**
> For users already using previous versions Railgun firmware for ramips/mt7621 (Before Jan 3 2023):
> Please notice that the firmware of these devices (newifi D2/newifi 3 and Phicomm K2P) has just switched to [padavanonly/immortalwrt](https://github.com/padavanonly/immortalwrt) source. **You will need a clean flash in your bootloader** (opboot, pbboot, or anything else) **other than upgrading in LuCI WebUI. And you will lose all your configurations. Do backups.**

> **Warning** 
> Phicomm K2P users: Since there's just not enough space to fit latest version of Xray-core into that tiny 16M SPI Flash, I have to remove luci-app-ssr-plus (a.k.a. helloworld) and replaced it with OpenClash, which in theory, combines with Clash.Meta core, should provide most functionalities. I didn't test it since I don't have the device on hand, if you ran into any issues, or you have a better implementation, feel free to open up an [issue](https://github.com/KevinMX/Railgun/issues), or discuss in [discussions](https://github.com/KevinMX/Railgun/discussions).

(I don't have the device on hand right ATM. Advice & bug reports welcome.)

Might be EOL soon (users are recommended to use ImmortalWrt SNAPSHOT instead)

| CPU / Architecture    | Device                                                                    |
|---------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| x86_64     | generic|
|mt7981|multiple devices|
|ipq40xx|[P&W R619AC](https://openwrt.org/toh/p_w/r619ac)|

> There's just no point to recompile again and again, wasting Actions CI's compute power. If ImmortalWrt mainline works well.

Since I daily drive this firmware as well, it might contain some dirty & ugly hacks. If you feel uncomfortable about this, do not use this firmware.

### If anything goes wrong...

If you think there's something wrong in my builds, feel free to create an [issue](https://github.com/KevinMX/Railgun/issues/new/choose). No annoying templates needed. Just remember to leave enough information (how to reproduce, necessary logs, etc) here. Nobody like guess your problem and come up with a solution out of no where :)

If you think the issue is from upstream projects, please open issues there.
